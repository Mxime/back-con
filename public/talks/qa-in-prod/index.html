      <h3>About</h3>

      <p>Are you tired of traditional software testing methods falling short in capturing real-world user experiences?
Join me on a journey into the world of testing in productionâ€”a revolutionary approach that challenges the status quo of software development.</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll explore how testing in production empowers developers to gain invaluable insights into their software's behavior, improve its quality, and enhance user satisfaction. 
From risk mitigation strategies like feature flags and canary releases to fostering a cultural shift towards experimentation and continuous improvement,
we'll uncover the tools and mindset needed to embrace this paradigm shift in software development.
Get ready to revolutionize your approach to building softwareâ€”testing in production is not just a concept, it's a game-changer.</p>

          <p>I've been at Back Market for 2 years, serving as a Software Development Engineer in Test for the QA Core team.
In this role, I create tools, establish guidelines, and refine processes to enhance our software quality standards.</p>
<p>As a naturally curious individual, I enjoy exploring new tools and technologies.
My favorite activity, however, is breaking and fixing things. 
Ever since childhood, I've been fascinated with taking apart my toys to understand their inner workings
and then reassembling or combining them in new ways.</p>
<p>Outside of work, you can usually find me at a restaurant or cafÃ©, sampling new dishes,
or planning my next travel adventure.
Exploring new places and trying different cuisines are among my greatest passions.</p>
