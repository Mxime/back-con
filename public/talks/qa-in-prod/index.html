    <p><p>Are you tired of traditional software testing methods falling short in capturing real-world user experiences?
Join me on a journey into the world of testing in production—a revolutionary approach that challenges the status quo of software development.</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll explore how testing in production empowers developers to gain invaluable insights into their software's behavior, improve its quality, and enhance user satisfaction. 
From risk mitigation strategies like feature flags and canary releases to fostering a cultural shift towards experimentation and continuous improvement,
we'll uncover the tools and mindset needed to embrace this paradigm shift in software development.
Get ready to revolutionize your approach to building software—testing in production is not just a concept, it's a game-changer.</p></p>
