"IT is about 0s and 1s."

We have all heard and **told** this story. But what does it mean? Are 0s and 1s about data? About computation? Or both?

CPUs (Central Processing Units) bridge data and code, but how does it work?

Let's learn how to build an *as simple as possible* CPU from transistors to the Assembly language.

**Concepts covered (non-contractual)**
- Transistors
- Logic Gates and Circuits
- Building Blocks of a CPU
- Von Neumann Architecture
- Instruction Set
