    <h1>An Introduction to the Go Programming Environment</h1>

    <p><p>Go is used at Back Market for infrastructure and platform needs. But this is not the only way to use it. 
In fact, Go is a perfectly valid language to build information systems, where you store data inside a database, display it in a nice web interface and expose it through a JSON API. </p>
<p>So in this talk, we're going to do just that! And we'll learn the language semantics and its common patterns along the way. It will be a real-life scenario that we'll even deploy at the end of the talk. Spoiler: what we're going to build will push forward the noble art of ping-pong at the office, stay tuned!</p></p>
