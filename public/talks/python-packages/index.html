    <h1>Demystifying Python packaging</h1>
    <h2>2024-06-18T11:00:00Z</h2>
    <h3></h3>

    <p><p>Python packaging is quite complex, and it's easy to be lost with all the options and concepts as an Engineer. Yet,
understanding the basic concepts of packaging can be helpful, even as a consumer of external libraries, as it can for
instance reduce dependency installation time, or reduce production Docker images size, if done correctly.</p>
<p>This talk's purpose is to give you a better understanding of some Python packaging concepts as a service maintainer,
by answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is a build backend?</li>
<li>what is a wheel, and what problems does it resolve?</li>
<li>why do some packages need to provide one wheel per OS architecture and/or Python version?</li>
<li>what is a dependency marker?</li>
</ul></p>

        <div><p>I've been at Back Market for 3,5 years and am a Backend Engineer in the Developer Experience Squad, automating as many
things as possible and praising Renovate at least once a week.</p>
<p>I'm deeply interested in automation, CI components, and Python packaging. I'm maintaining an open-source library that
helps Engineers find misusages of dependencies in Python codebases, and have also made contributions to various
open-source projects related to packaging (including Poetry in the past), so I know quite a bit about this subject.</p>
<p>Outside of work, you can either find me on a bike, or running, or at the nearest bar, depending on the day! I also
really enjoy going to concerts (some might say a bit too much!), and often enjoy playing video games, with friends or
alone (Hollow Knight: Silksong when?).</p></div>
