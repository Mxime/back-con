      <h3>About</h3>

      <p>With the Badoom sunset, migration of big scope can be a nightmare.
Any little feature can quickly require to extract a big block at the same time, and we donâ€™t want to stop developing new features.
We will share with you how we used the hexagonal architecture of our service to allow an iterative and risk-free extraction.</p>

          <p>I've been at Back Market for 2,5 years as a Backend Engineer in the Mojo tribe. I started in the Finance squad and i'm now working in the Order Management squad. Before I worked for 13 years in agencies and consulting companies, and for the few recent years in startups.</p>
<p>Otherwise, i have a passion for escape game, as you can see here: https://www.the-escapers.com/profil/julian-le-calvez and rhum (I don't have a profile yet).
But mostly I enjoy spending time with friends, cook, or just chill in from of the TV. </p>
