    <h1>How to teach AI to code with your tools? An intro to function calling</h1>

    <p><p>Function calling is the ability to reliably connect LLMs to external tools to enable effective tool usage and interaction with any API.</p>
<p>For example function calling enables you to create:</p>
<ul>
<li>applications that will convert natural language to valid API calls or database queries</li>
<li>solutions to extract and tag complex data pattern from text (e.g. retrieving names or personal information from text)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this talk, we are going to see what is function calling, how to implement it and illustrate its usage with concrete examples.</p></p>
