Function calling is the ability to reliably connect LLMs to external tools to enable effective tool usage and interaction with any API.

- solutions to extract and tag complex data pattern from text (e.g. retrieving names or personal information from text)

In this talk, we are going to see what is function calling, how to implement it and illustrate its usage with concrete examples.
