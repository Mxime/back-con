Yes, I had a couple of bad times these days during the code review process.
Through this talk, I'll share with you three short stories (based on real-life events) that highlight how we can almost kill our fellow coworkers with frustration.

But you know, what didn't kill us make us stronger. ðŸ’ª

Whether we are reviewer or reviewee, we'll try to convert the experience we got from frustration into actionable solution that will makes everybody enjoy the code review!
