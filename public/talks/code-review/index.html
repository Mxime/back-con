      <h3>About</h3>

      <p>Yes, I had a couple of bad times these days during the code review process.
Through this talk, I'll share with you three short stories (based on real-life events) that highlight how we can almost kill our fellow coworkers with frustration.</p>
<p>But you know, what doesn't kill us makes us stronger. üí™</p>
<p>Whether we are reviewer or reviewee, we'll try to convert the experience we got from frustration into actionable solutions that will make everybody enjoy the code review!</p>

<br />I'm part of the B2C Service team where everybody do it.</p>
<p>When I'm not running with Jessica in the Bordeaux docks, I'm supposed to align <code>div</code>s all around the backmarket website.</p>
<p>My last project was to allow people to add a Bouygues mobile plan to their order ‚Äì feel free to test it but please send me a DM if you find any misaligned <code>div</code>!</p>
