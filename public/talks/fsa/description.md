> Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

That's a question we dread to be asked in interviews, but this time we asked it to our dear Back Market architecture.
Without a doubt, our current stack has gotten us this far on the journey but we're also feeling some growing pains.

In this talk, we'll try to review what these pains are, what tradeoffs we intend to make along the way
to our vision for the next phase of Back Market.

Architecture is constantly evolving to balance some pros and cons and we'll be counting
on you to keep evolving this vision as well.
