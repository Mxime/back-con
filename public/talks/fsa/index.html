    <p><blockquote>
  <p>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a question we dread to be asked in interviews, but this time we asked it to our dear Back Market architecture.
Without a doubt, our current stack has gotten us this far on the journey but we're also feeling some growing pains.</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll try to review what these pains are, what tradeoffs we intend to make along the way
to our vision for the next phase of Back Market.</p>
<p>Architecture is constantly evolving to balance some pros and cons and we'll be counting
on you to keep evolving this vision as well.</p></p>

        <div><p>I've been a Staff Engineer at Back Market for 18 months now!
During my career so far i've been lucky enough to make a lot of mistakes
in a lot of various contexts, usually around web oriented architectures because I'm a firm believer
in the Open Web and <em>libre</em> software in general.</p>
<p>These mistakes have led me to believe that they're a part of the job and
that we can only hope to make more of them, but smaller, more frequently
and in a controlled way.</p>
<p>If you approach me to chat, I can rave about software crafting, lean and agility, all colours
as long as they're purple, why I hate dolphins or why Beatles &gt; Stones.</p></div>
