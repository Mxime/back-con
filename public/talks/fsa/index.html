      <h3>About</h3>

      <blockquote>
  <p>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a question we dread to be asked in interviews, but this time we asked it to our dear Back Market architecture.
Without a doubt, our current stack has gotten us this far on the journey but we're also feeling some growing pains.</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll try to review what these pains are, what tradeoffs we intend to make along the way
to our vision for the next phase of Back Market.</p>
<p>Architecture is constantly evolving to balance some pros and cons and we'll be counting
on you to keep evolving this vision as well.</p>

          <p>I've been a Staff Engineer at Back Market for 18 months now!
During my career so far i've been lucky enough to make a lot of mistakes
in a lot of various contexts, usually around web oriented architectures because I'm a firm believer
in the Open Web and <em>libre</em> software in general.</p>
<p>These mistakes have led me to believe that they're a part of the job and
that we can only hope to make more of them, but smaller, more frequently
and in a controlled way.</p>
<p>If you approach me to chat, I can rave about software crafting, lean and agility, all colours
as long as they're purple, why I hate dolphins or why Beatles &gt; Stones.</p>

          <p>I'm a Staff Data Engineer based in Bordeaux, France. 
When I'm not busy talking with Monster AI or exploring what we can do with our datasets, you can find me near the coffee machine. 
Don't ask me to solve complex challenges â€” I'm still trying to figure out how to turn the coffee machine into a self-service data tool!</p>
