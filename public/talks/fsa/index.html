    <p><blockquote>
  <p>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a question we dread to be asked in interviews, but this time we asked it to our dear Back Market architecture.
Without a doubt, our current stack has gotten us this far on the journey but we're also feeling some growing pains.</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll try to review what these pains are, what tradeoffs we intend to make along the way
to our vision for the next phase of Back Market.</p>
<p>Architecture is constantly evolving to balance some pros and cons and we'll be counting
on you to keep evolving this vision as well.</p></p>
