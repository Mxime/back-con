In this talk, you will learn how Airflow enabled us to easily build, test, schedule, and monitor Workflow in Python!
We will develop Airflow's usage in the data lifecycle such as:
- Integrating and transforming data in BigQuery
- Sending it to third-parties
- Training ML models
- Monitoring data integrity and quality in BigQuery
- Managing infrastructure
