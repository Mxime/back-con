      <h3>About</h3>

      <p>Join us for an exciting talk where you'll discover how our data workflows are built, tested, scheduled and monitored via AirFlow in the python environment.</p>
<p>Perfect for beginners, this session will cover how Airflow is used throughout the data lifecycle, including data transformation, data distribution to third-party, machine learning, data quality monitoring and data infrastructure management.</p>
<p>By the end of this talk, you'll understand how Airflow can enhance your data projects and simplify complex processes.</p>

          <p>I joined Back Market 19 months ago, where I've been passionately advocating for Airflow and building robust Data Platforms.</p>
<p>With 6 years of experience in scaling pipelines with Airflow at various companies like PayFit and Shine, I've fine-tuned my skills in streamlining data processes and ensuring smooth workflow management.</p>

          <p>I have been at Back Marker for 5Â½ years, and belonged to almost as many teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>First I worked in the Catalog squad, on the very first micro-service (it never reached prod)</li>
<li>Then I contributed to the seller back-office in the MJCAT-MJ-MCC team</li>
<li>In the Payout squad, I helped build the infamous <code>balkani</code> service</li>
<li>Then I became a traitor to the back-end community and joined the Data Engineers</li>
<li>And recently, I betrayed them as well, and went back to MoJo as a back-end</li>
</ul>
<p>I started developing 22 years ago. At the time, I was into an email-based RPG set
in a virtual nation called the <em>SÃ©rÃ©nyssime Empire d'Ys</em>.
To bring the nation to life, we developed a platform to manage the
characters' identity, their bank accounts, their properties, and so on,
using PHP and SQL with no ORM.
Today I'm still a fan of mails and SQL, but I have never touched PHP again.</p>

          <p>After a 5 years stint as an Aeronautical engineer, working on aircraft engines, Iâ€™ve switched careers into Data.
That was ~7 years ago, and I havenâ€™t looked back !</p>
<p>Since then, Iâ€™ve had the chance to do a lot of different things: Data Engineering, Data Science, Devops/Automation, Platform Engineering, Infrastructure, and even a small bit of back end development.</p>
<p>I joined BackMarket 18 months ago as a Machine Learning Engineering, which is a fancy way to say that I do whatever I can to help our Data Scientists transforming their insights and models into value in production.</p>
