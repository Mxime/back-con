At Back Market since 1 year and a half. I worked with finance tools squad on tools and tax topics. 

I am now part of the Order management squad and working on new projects Bouygues and Monthly insurance. Of course our biggest challenge to come will be the OMS sunset.

Before that, I have worked in IoT for Renault and EDF and on finance building a KYC and ledger application.
