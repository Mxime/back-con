Hey there, I'm gui, not G.U.I., or guy, or Guy, or any other nonsense, just gui, as in Guillaume (ghee-yom), right? I'm watching you.

One of the few Bordeaux folks actually coming from the Bordeaux area. I do Front, previously in Care, and now in Customer Journey, as (acting) Staff Engineer.

Bisous
