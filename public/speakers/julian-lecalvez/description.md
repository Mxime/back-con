I've been at Back Market for 2,5 years as a Backend Engineer in the Mojo tribe. I started in the Finance squad and i'm now working in the Order Management squad. Before I worked for 13 years in agencies and consulting companies, and for the few recent years in startups.

Otherwise, i have a passion for escape game, as you can see here: https://www.the-escapers.com/profil/julian-le-calvez and rhum (I don't have a profile yet).
But mostly I enjoy spending time with friends, cook, or just chill in from of the TV.
