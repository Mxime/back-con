Hey there! I'm Michel Chanthavong, your friendly neighborhood Frontend Engineer at Back Market, rocking the Customer Journey - B2C Services team from the heart of Paris. Picture me as the Spider-Man of frontend technologies, swinging through code to save the day and make your user experience as smooth as a French baguette.

In the BOT division, I’m not just a cog in the machine; I’m the whole darn gearbox! I’m part of the bot-chapter-frontend, bot-chapter-frontend-release-managers, bot-paris, bot-squad-b2cservices, and bot-team. Basically, if there’s a bot in the name, I’m probably in it.

When I’m not busy making the web a better place, you’ll find me perfecting the art of creating seamless and efficient web interfaces. My journey at Back Market is like a thrilling rollercoaster ride, full of twists, turns, and a whole lot of sustainable tech solutions.
