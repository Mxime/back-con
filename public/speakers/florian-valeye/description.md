I'm a Staff Data Engineer based in Bordeaux, France. 
When I'm not busy talking with Monster AI or exploring what we can do with our datasets, you can find me near the coffee machine. 
Don't ask me to solve complex challenges â€” I'm still trying to figure out how to turn his coffee machine into a self-service data tool!
