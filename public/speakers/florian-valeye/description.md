Florian Valeye is a Staff Data Engineer based in Bordeaux, France. 
When he's not busy talking with Monster AI or exploring what we can do with our datasets, you can find him near the coffee machine. 
Don't ask him to solve complex challenges â€” he's still trying to figure out how to turn his coffee machine into a self-service data tool!
