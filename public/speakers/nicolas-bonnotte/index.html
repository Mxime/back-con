      <h1>Nicolas BONNOTTE</h1>
      <h3>Money Journey - Finance - Finance Experience</h3>
      <p>Senior Backend Engineer II</p>
    </header>

    <main><p>I have been at Back Marker for 5Â½ years, and belonged to almost as many teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>First I worked in the Catalog squad, on the very first micro-service (it never reached prod)</li>
<li>Then I contributed to the seller back-office in the MJCAT-MJ-MCC team</li>
<li>In the Payout squad, I helped build the infamous <code>balkani</code> service</li>
<li>Then I became a traitor to the back-end community and joined the Data Engineers</li>
<li>And recently, I betrayed them as well, and went back to MoJo as a back-end</li>
</ul>
<p>I started developing 22 years ago. At the time, I was into an email-based RPG set
in a virtual nation called the <em>SÃ©rÃ©nyssime Empire d'Ys</em>.
To bring the nation to life, we developed a platform to manage the
characters' identity, their bank accounts, their properties, and so on,
using PHP and SQL with no ORM.
Today I'm still a fan of mails and SQL, but I have never touched PHP again.</p></main>
