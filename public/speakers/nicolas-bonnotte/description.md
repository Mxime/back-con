I have been at Back Marker for 5½ years, and belonged to almost as many teams:
- First I worked in the Catalog squad, on the very first micro-service (it never reached prod)
- Then I contributed to the seller back-office in the MJCAT-MJ-MCC team
- In the Payout squad, I helped build the infamous `balkani` service
- Then I became a traitor to the back-end community and joined the Data Engineers
- And recently, I betrayed them as well, and went back to MoJo as a back-end

I started developing 22 years ago. At the time, I was into an email-based RPG set
in a virtual nation called the _Sérényssime Empire d'Ys_.
To bring the nation to life, we developed a platform to manage the
characters' identity, their bank accounts, their properties, and so on,
using PHP and SQL with no ORM.
Today I'm still a fan of mails and SQL, but I have never touched PHP again.
