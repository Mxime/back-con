Full time dad, almost anthopologist and sunday cyclist; in my spare time I am a frontend developer at Back Market (since 2022).
I love simple code and minimalist interfaces.

You may have heard of me as:

- the other Italian in the Trade-in team 
- the co-host for the Weekly Meeting of the Frontend Chapter
- the co-organizer of the Front Meetup in Paris (first physical meetup of all front devs in BM)
- the guy who came by bike to the 2023 All Hands from BDX. And then returned to BDX (not this year, just because I am doing another crazy thing the week after)  

Living in the South East of France, between the Alps and the Mediterranean sea.
**And nope, no cream for the Carbonara!**
