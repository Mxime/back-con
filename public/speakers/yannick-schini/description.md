After a 5 years stint as an Aeronautical engineer, working on aircraft engines, I’ve switched careers into Data.
That was ~7 years ago, and I haven’t looked back !

Since then, I’ve had the chance to do a lot of different things: Data Engineering, Data Science, Devops/Automation, Platform Engineering, Infrastructure, and even a small bit of back end development.

I joined BackMarket 18 months ago as a Machine Learning Engineering, which is a fancy way to say that I do whatever I can to help our Data Scientists transforming their insights and models into value in production.
