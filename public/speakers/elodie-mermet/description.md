Hey! I'm Elodie Mermet, a designer at Back Market. I get to flex my creative muscles every day to make sure our user experiences are top-notch and align with our mission of promoting sustainable tech. I work closely with different squads and tribes, like the Customer Journey and Seller Tribe, to keep everything looking and feeling just right.

From brainstorming and research to final tweaks and user testing, I'm all in. I use tools like Figma and Confluence to whip up high-fidelity designs and prototypes that are both beautiful and super user-friendly. I'm all about design excellence and making sure our users have the best experience possible.
