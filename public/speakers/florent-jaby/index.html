      <p><p>I've been a Staff Engineer at Back Market for 18 months now!
During my career so far i've been lucky enough to make a lot of mistakes
in a lot of various contexts, usually around web oriented architectures because I'm a firm believer
in the Open Web and <em>libre</em> software in general.</p>
<p>These mistakes have led me to believe that they're a part of the job and
that we can only hope to make more of them, but smaller, more frequently
and in a controlled way.</p>
<p>If you approach me to chat, I can rave about software crafting, lean and agility, all colours
as long as they're purple, why I hate dolphins or why Beatles &gt; Stones.</p></p>
