Did you know you can eat your kiwi with the peel? ü•ù Well, now you know.
<br />I'm part of the B2C Service team where everybody do it.

When I'm not running with Jessica in the Bordeaux docks, I'm supposed to align `div`s all around the backmarket website.

My last project was to allow people to add a Bouygues mobile plan to their order ‚Äì feel free to test it but please send me a DM if you find any misaligned `div`!
