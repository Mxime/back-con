I joined Back Market in january, 2024 as a Principal Engineer.

Before Back Market, I spent almost 3 years at Doctolib, during the Covid-19 and vaccination campaign.
I am also one of the creator and organizer of Devoxx France, a conference for developers in Paris, in April.

You can find me in the Paris office, usually on Monday and Thursday at 2nd floor :-)

You can follow me on X/Twitter @nmartignole and read some articles in ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· on [my blog](https://www.touilleur-express.fr/).
