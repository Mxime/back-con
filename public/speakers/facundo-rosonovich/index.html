      <p><p>I've been at Back Market for 2 years, serving as a Software Development Engineer in Test for the QA Core team.
In this role, I create tools, establish guidelines, and refine processes to enhance our software quality standards.</p>
<p>As a naturally curious individual, I enjoy exploring new tools and technologies.
My favorite activity, however, is breaking and fixing things. 
Ever since childhood, I've been fascinated with taking apart my toys to understand their inner workings
and then reassembling or combining them in new ways.</p>
<p>Outside of work, you can usually find me at a restaurant or café, sampling new dishes,
or planning my next travel adventure.
Exploring new places and trying different cuisines are among my greatest passions.</p></p>
