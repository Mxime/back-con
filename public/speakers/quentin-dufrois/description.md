Backend engineer, I have been working at Back Market for 5 years. I currently belong to the circularity team. I also give a bit of my time to the IT for Dummies initiative. I enjoy working on and discussing about various topics such as monitoring, caching or Kubernetes.
Fun fact: before joining BM, I was a chemist.
