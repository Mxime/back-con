I've been enjoying my role as a front-end developer at Back Market for 4 years now!

My goal is to build solutions that meet users' needs, and I strive not to leave anyone out. That's why accessibility is one of my key interests.

If I'm not on my laptop, you'll probably find me with my dog, knitting, sewing, or gardening.
