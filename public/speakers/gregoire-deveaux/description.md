I've been playing with websites since before Google was there, and working at Back Market since 2020.

I try to keep it stupid simple.

Here are some mantras I like, can you tell which ones are from the [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and which ones are from the [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)?
- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Now is better than never.
