      <h1>Mathieu KNIEWALLNER</h1>
      <h3>Platform - DevServices - DevXP</h3>
      <p>Senior Backend Engineer II</p>
    </header>

    <main><p>I've been at Back Market for 3,5 years and am a Backend Engineer in the Developer Experience Squad, automating as many
things as possible and praising Renovate at least once a week.</p>
<p>I'm deeply interested in automation, CI components, and Python packaging. I'm maintaining an open-source library that
helps Engineers find misusages of dependencies in Python codebases, and have also made contributions to various
open-source projects related to packaging (including Poetry in the past), so I know quite a bit about this subject.</p>
<p>Outside of work, you can either find me on a bike, or running, or at the nearest bar, depending on the day! I also
really enjoy going to concerts (some might say a bit too much!), and often enjoy playing video games, with friends or
alone (Hollow Knight: Silksong when?).</p></main>
