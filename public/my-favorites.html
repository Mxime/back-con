<p>That's a question we dread to be asked in interviews, but this time we asked it to our dear Back Market architecture.
Without a doubt, our current stack has gotten us this far on the journey but we're also feeling some growing pains.</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll try to review what these pains are, what tradeoffs we intend to make along the way
to our vision for the next phase of Back Market.</p>
<p>Architecture is constantly evolving to balance some pros and cons and we'll be counting
on you to keep evolving this vision as well.</p></div>

<p>This talk's purpose is to give you a better understanding of some Python packaging concepts as a service maintainer,
by answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is a build backend?</li>
<li>what is a wheel, and what problems does it resolve?</li>
<li>why do some packages need to provide one wheel per OS architecture and/or Python version?</li>

In fact, Go is a perfectly valid language to build information systems, where you store data inside a database, display it in a nice web interface and expose it through a JSON API. </p>
<p>So in this talk, we're going to do just that! And we'll learn the language semantics and its common patterns along the way. It will be a real-life scenario that we'll even deploy at the end of the talk. Spoiler: what we're going to build will push forward the noble art of ping-pong at the office, stay tuned!</p></div>
